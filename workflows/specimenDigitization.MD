# Specimen Digitization - Ecdysis portal

To digitize a specimen, go to the proper collection in Ecdysis and toggle the editor/admin panel.  See collection tools workflow for locating and operating these tools.

Click on the 'Add New Occurrence Record' link to go to the record digitization form.

## Primary occurrence data
These fields are somewhat self explanitory and the green question-mark icon will bring up additional information on the Darwin-Core term for that field.

### Enter base data and look for previous records from same collecting event
![Search for duplicates 1](duplicateSearch1.png)
* Start by entering the unique catalog number which matches the physical label being added to the specimen.
* Enter the collector name (at least last name, write as it appears on the label) and the date from the specimen (translate to the format YYYY-MM-DD).
* Click the 'Dupes' button to search the database for possible duplicate specimens collected by a person with the same last name on the given date.
![Search for duplicates 2](duplicateSearch2.png)
* If possible duplicates exist, a window will pop-up with matches.
* If one of the possible matches is the same as the specimen in front of you, click the 'Transfer all fields' to transfer all the data to your current specimen record.  You may also select 'Transfer to empty fields only' if you have already digitized part of the specimen and you do not wish to overwrite that information.
* If you transfer full data, then most likely the only data still needed is the determination data.


### Enter additional collector data
* Add any additional collectors in the 'Additional Collectors' field
* The 'Verbatim Date' field should contain only the date as exactly typed/written on the specimen label, or it can be left blank.
* Clicking the +pencil icon opens additional date fiends which include the ability to add a range of dates, e.g. for specimens from long term traps.

### Latest Identification data
This part of the form is where the current/latest identification is added at the time of digitization. Future new determinations can be added by the batch annotation tool or using the identifications tab on an existing record.

* Almost all identifications will include a taxon name, a determiner, and a date determined (almost always simply a year for insect specimens)
* By starting to type a scientific name, matches are shown as a drop-down menu.  If the taxon is not in the taxonomy, it should be added to the portal taxonomic thesaurus.
* Add any additional information about the identification such as qualifiers (e.g., c.f. near, etc), notes, or known identification resources.
